        <p class="lead">The Origins</p>
        <p class="lead">Foudned in 1846, the city of Texas was named after militia captain John B. Denton.
            The city remained small until 1881 when the arrival of a railway line spurred population. Shortly after
            The University of North Texas was founded in 1890 followed by Texas Womens University in 1901. The
            establishment of two universities set Denton apart from the surrounding cities and population continued to grow rapidly.
            The completion of the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in 1974 made Denton more accessable and pushed Denton to become
            the 200th most populated city in the United States.</p>
        <p class="lead">Life in Denton</p>
        <p class="lead">Music</p>
        <p class="lead">One of the most well known aspects of Denton life is its music scene. The local independent music scene
             in Denton has emerged alongside Denton's academic music establishments, including the University
              of North Texas College of Music. The city's live music venues are largely supported by 
              Denton's college-town atmosphere, although show attendance is bolstered by area residents.
               The Dallas Observer features a column on Denton's local music scene. In 2007 and 2008,
                Denton's music scene received feature attention from The Guardian, Pop Matters, and The New
                 York Times. Paste Magazine named Denton's music scene the best in the United States in
                  2008. The city-sponsored Denton Arts and Jazz Festival attracts over 200,000 people 
                  each year for live music, food, crafts, and recreation at Civic Center Park.</p>
